VIMFILES
========
This project is a placeholder my personal vim configuration. I'm a basic 
level vim user and I want my configuration is accessible from every 
computer I have. That way, I wouldn't have to spend my time just to 
reconfigure vim.

Usage
-----
Clone this repository and copy the contents of vim to $HOME/.vim, and 
vimrc to $HOME/.vimrc
